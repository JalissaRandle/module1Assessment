// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = " This is the second step, this is the process of determening user expextations for new or modified product  "

const design = " this is the third step, it's the process of envisioning and definfing software soulutions to one or more set of problems "

const implementation = "this is the fourth step, that involves the transformation of the software TDP into one or more fabricated, intergrated and tested software configuration items that are ready for software acceptance testing."

const testingAndIntergration = "this is the fifth step, which is a type of testing in chich different units, modules or componets of a software aplication are tested as a combined entity."

const maintain = "This is the sixth step which is the process of changing, modifing, and updating software to keep up with customer needs."
